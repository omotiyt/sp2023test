    <h2>On this page, I'd like to introduce some of my favorite places.</h2>
    <h2>Since I grew up in Japan, most of my favorite places are in Japan.</h2><br>
    <div class="flex">
    <h3><p>This is Yokohama Landmark Tower. The tower is the third tallest building and fifth tallest structure in Japan. It was near my house in Japan, so I visited quite often. There are offices, shopping centers, and a hotel inside.</p>
